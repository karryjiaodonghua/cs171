          <h3>What is Malaria?</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female mosquitoes. Young children, pregnant women and non-immune travellers from malaria-free areas are particularly vulnerable to the disease when they become infected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although many in America are far removed from the effects of Malaria, about 3.2 billion people – almost <em>half</em> of the world’s population – are at risk of malaria. Fortunately, malaria is preventable and curable, and increased efforts are dramatically reducing the malaria burden in many places.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The malaria parasite has been killing children and sapping the strength of whole populations for tens of thousands of years. It is impossible to calculate the harm malaria has done to the world... There are more people dying of malaria than any specific cancer.</p>
